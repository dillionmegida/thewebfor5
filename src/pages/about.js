            {Brand.name} is a blog platform for demystifying web topics as
            assumed to be teaching a five year old. It was launched by{" "}
            {Brand.founder.name} on January 1st, 2020 (more details on him
            below).
          </p>
          <p>
            So far, there are <b>{noOfArticles}</b> articles already written.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are undeniably numerous platforms already built for teaching
            web topics but this hopes to be different such that the topics
            aren't entirely explained in technical terms but simpler ones which
            a five year old would understand. Also note that despite the means
            used in explanation, the technicalities involved in such topics
            would not be left behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The little requirement for five year olds (lol) hoping to learn from
            this platform is that they should have the appetite for reading.
            This is stated because literally, five year olds wouldn't actually
            like reading. Right?{" "}
